                This collection catalogs research conducted using PEDSnet data, including both active projects and those initiated 
                or completed since 2018. These studies reflect the wide-ranging capabilities of the PEDSnet Learning Health System, 
                which integrates data from multiple pediatric institutions to support scalable, real-world evidence generation. Each 
                study entry is linked to its corresponding peer-reviewed publications, as well as any concept sets, phenotype 
                algorithms, or analytic tools developed during its course—enabling transparency, reproducibility, and reuse across 
                future research efforts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Studies in the collection are systematically organized by funding project, data source, and thematic area, making it 
                easy to explore based on research focus or collaborative network. Studies conducted as part of large grant-funded 
                projects such as the Glomerular Disease Learning Network (GLEAN) or Pediatric KIDney Stone (PKIDS) Care Improvement 
                Network, or Preserving Kidney Function in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (PRESERVE). Data source domains include 
                PCORnet® Study and PEDSnet Study designation. Thematic categories include work in phenotype development and large scale 
                network infrastructure support work. PEDSnet studies span domains such as chronic disease management, rare disease 
                characterization, health equity, care utilization, and outcomes-based quality improvement.
              </p>
              <p>
                By showcasing this breadth of research, the collection not only serves as a valuable resource for current investigators 
                but also highlights the ongoing contributions of PEDSnet to advancing learning health systems research, where continuous 
                improvement in care is informed by systematically gathered and analyzed data.

                This collection contains variable definitions based on phenotypic algorithms that identify cohorts of patients exhibiting 
                specific clinical characteristics, conditions, or patterns of interest, as derived from electronic health records (EHRs). 
                These phenotypes are defined using logic statements (algorithms) with combinations of diagnosis codes, procedures, medications, 
                laboratory results, and other structured EHR data elements (concept sets) to represent real-world clinical presentations. The 
                collection is designed to support reproducibility and consistency across studies by clearly outlining the logic used to define 
                each phenotype. It complements the PEDSnet concept set collection by offering a high-level overview of the variables defined in 
                PEDSnet research, enabling users to explore how clinical features are operationalized across studies.

              <p>
                Concept sets, also known as code sets or value sets, are curated collections of standardized clinical codes used to represent 
                specific clinical ideas, conditions, or treatments. These sets play a critical role in clinical research, healthcare analytics, 
                and electronic health record (EHR) systems by enabling consistent identification and grouping of medical information across 
                different data sources. Concept sets are typically built using standardized terminologies such as SNOMED CT, ICD-10, HCPCS, 
                and RxNorm, which ensure semantic consistency and interoperability.
              </p>
              <p>
                This particular collection includes concept sets developed as part of PEDSnet research initiatives. These sets are often used 
                in combination with algorithmic logic to define and identify patient cohorts for observational studies and data analyses. While 
                the Variable Definitions collection includes the accompanying logic and criteria used to operationalize these concepts, this 
                collection focuses exclusively on the concept sets themselves.
              </p>
              <p>The concept sets are systematically organized into eight clinical domains:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Devices</li>
                <li>Diagnoses</li>
                <li>Procedures</li>
                <li>Visits</li>
                <li>Laboratory results</li>
                <li>Physiological measurements</li>
                <li>Environmental and socioeconomic variables</li>
                <li>Medications</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each set includes individual codes representing approved, standardized concepts drawn from reputable clinical ontologies. These 
                sets support reproducible research by ensuring that definitions of conditions or interventions are transparent and consistently applied.
              </p>
              <p>
                All concept sets are available for download in CSV format via PEDSpace, making them easy to integrate into data analysis workflows 
                or cohort-building tools.

                This collection offers access to an array of study-specific and network-level data quality analysis modules, designed to support 
                robust and reliable clinical observational research within a learning health system like PEDSnet. High-quality data is foundational 
                to generating valid, actionable insights in such systems where research and practice are tightly integrated. These modules enable 
                the systematic exploration, validation, and presentation of data, ensuring that analyses are grounded in trusted, well-characterized 
                datasets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Researchers can browse the collection to identify categories of data quality analyses or filter to select checks that align with 
                specific stages of the research lifecycle—from initial cohort design to final analysis. The PEDSnet Data Quality Program supports 
                this framework by establishing standards and tools for continuous data improvement across institutions and studies.
              </p>
              <p>The Data Quality Collection comprises a comprehensive set of modules targeting key areas of concern in data quality assessment, including:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Cohort Fitness:</strong> Evaluating whether a dataset can adequately represent the intended population.</li>
                <li><strong>Cohort Identification:</strong> Validating inclusion/exclusion logic using real-world data signals.</li>
                <li><strong>Concept Set Testing:</strong> Ensuring the accuracy and appropriateness of clinical concept definitions.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Conformance:</strong> Checking for adherence to data model standards and vocabularies.</li>
                <li><strong>Dataset Fitness:</strong> Assessing completeness, consistency, and temporal coverage of data.</li>
                <li><strong>Variable Testing:</strong> Verifying the presence, distribution, and utility of analytic variables.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each module includes up to eight targeted data quality checks, which assess parameters such as temporality (e.g., whether data meets 
                time-based expectations), data source scope (single vs. multiple sites or systems), and the detection of anomalies (e.g., outliers 
                or implausible values).
              </p>
              <p>
                To support reproducibility and transparency, this collection is linked to a complementary GitHub repository, where users can access 
                and implement the source code for these functions directly in their workflows.
