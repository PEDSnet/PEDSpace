                This collection catalogs research conducted using PEDSnet data, including both active projects and those initiated 
                or completed since 2018. These studies reflect the wide-ranging capabilities of the PEDSnet Learning Health System, 
                which integrates data from multiple pediatric institutions to support scalable, real-world evidence generation. Each 
                study entry is linked to its corresponding peer-reviewed publications, as well as any concept sets, phenotype 
                algorithms, or analytic tools developed during its course—enabling transparency, reproducibility, and reuse across 
                future research efforts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Studies in the collection are systematically organized by funding project, data source, and thematic area, making it 
                easy to explore based on research focus or collaborative network. Studies conducted as part of large grant-funded 
                projects such as the Glomerular Disease Learning Network (GLEAN) or Pediatric KIDney Stone (PKIDS) Care Improvement 
                Network, or Preserving Kidney Function in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (PRESERVE). Data source domains include 
                PCORnet® Study and PEDSnet Study designation.
              </p>
              <p>
                By showcasing this breadth of research, the collection not only serves as a valuable resource for current investigators 
                but also highlights the ongoing contributions of PEDSnet to advancing learning health systems research, where continuous 
                improvement in care is informed by systematically gathered and analyzed data.

                This collection contains variable definitions based on phenotypic algorithms that identify cohorts of patients exhibiting 
                specific clinical characteristics, conditions, or patterns of interest, as derived from electronic health records (EHRs). 
                These phenotypes are defined using logic statements (algorithms) with combinations of diagnosis codes, procedures, medications, 
                laboratory results, and other structured EHR data elements (concept sets) to represent real-world clinical presentations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The collection is designed to support reproducibility and consistency across studies by clearly outlining the logic used to define 
                each phenotype. It complements the PEDSnet concept set collection by offering a high-level overview of the variables defined in 
                PEDSnet research, enabling users to explore how clinical features are operationalized across studies.

              <p>
                Concept sets, also known as code sets or value sets, are curated collections of standardized clinical codes used to represent 
                specific clinical ideas, conditions, or treatments. These sets play a critical role in clinical research, healthcare analytics, 
                and electronic health record (EHR) systems by enabling consistent identification and grouping of medical information across 
                different data sources. Concept sets are typically built using standardized terminologies such as SNOMED CT, ICD-10, HCPCS, 
                and RxNorm, which ensure semantic consistency and interoperability.
              </p>
              <p>
                This particular collection includes concept sets developed as part of PEDSnet research initiatives. These sets are often used 
                in combination with algorithmic logic to define and identify patient cohorts for observational studies and data analyses.
              </p>
              <p>The concept sets are systematically organized into eight clinical domains:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Devices</li>
                <li>Diagnoses</li>

                <li>Medications</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each set includes individual codes representing approved, standardized concepts drawn from reputable clinical ontologies. All 
                concept sets are available for download in CSV format via PEDSpace, making them easy to integrate into data analysis workflows 
                or cohort-building tools.
